## Why MkDocs?
I wanted a simple way to document my homelab and share it with others.

## What is MkDocs?
MkDocs is a static site generator for project documentation. It's written in Python and uses Markdown for content.

## How to use it?
1. Create a `docs` directory in your project.
2. Create Markdown files in the `docs` directory.
3. Create a `mkdocs.yml` file to configure your site.
4. Run `mkdocs serve` to preview your site.
5. Run `mkdocs build` to generate the static site.
6. Run `mkdocs gh-deploy` to deploy to GitHub Pages.
